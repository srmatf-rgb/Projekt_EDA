💎 King County Luxury Real Estate: Investment Strategy
👤 Prepared for: Jennifer Montgomery (High-End Stakeholder)
This project delivers a data-driven investment strategy for a high-budget client. The goal: Identify a "Statement Property" in King County for a high-prestige lifestyle and a profitable resell within 12 months.

🎯 The Mission
Jennifer Montgomery is looking for more than a home—she wants a status symbol. My analysis focuses on:

High-End Quality: Only houses with Architectural Grade 10-13.

The "Show-off" Factor: Exclusive waterfront locations.

Maximum ROI: Identifying features that drive the "Price per sqft" for a quick 1-year exit.

📊 Key Data Insights (EDA)
Our Exploratory Data Analysis revealed three primary value drivers:

The Location Goldmine: Waterfront properties are in a different asset class. The price per sqft is 94% higher than inland ($508 vs $262). Scarcity ensures long-term value.

The Renovation Bonus: In the luxury segment, renovated homes command an average $500,000 premium over original conditions.

The Size Multiplier: While standard homes grow linearly, luxury homes show an exponential price increase with size. "Bigger is better" is the rule for prestige buyers.

💡 Strategic Recommendations
Target the "Gold Coast": Focus exclusively on waterfront properties to guarantee exclusivity.

Buy "Ready-to-Move-In": To meet the 1-year resell window, Jennifer should prioritize renovated homes (Grade 11+) to attract premium buyers immediately.

Go Big: Choose properties with maximum square footage, as size is the biggest driver for resale profit in this segment.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
Python: Data cleaning and statistical analysis.

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and segmenting.

Seaborn & Matplotlib: Professional business visualizations.

DBeaver/SQL: Initial database exploration.
